# Magic-8-Ball
Python program that integrates an import of tkinter in order to process outside of the terminal. I also have a program file as well as an custom module file that I have imported into my own program. This project includes a log.txt file that update real time and documents with timestamps.

There are two available files. In order to run this program you will want both files downloaded. 
*mod_imp.py *magicball.py

The main program file is *magicball.py and will automatically generate a log.txt file if it cannot be found.

I used several imports for this file that is already pre-loaded with python. 

mod_imp.py is open-source and is free to use for anyone that needs or want's to play around with it. It doesn't do much besides compile all the possible 8-ball answers. It also has a function for ignore special characters.
